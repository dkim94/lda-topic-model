# lda-topic-model

## Topic Modeling
- Topic Modeling aims to find the most representative topic (or topics) for a given  set of documents. 
<br/><br/>

## LDA as Topic Modeling
- #TODO: explain a little in your own words
- Look [here](https://ratsgo.github.io/from%20frequency%20to%20semantics/2017/06/01/LDA/) for a more thorough explanation. (Korean)
- [Here](https://youtu.be/T05t-SqKArY) is a great explanatory youtube video. (English)
- Or [here](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/blei03a/blei03a.pdf) if you're smart enough (I am most certainly not)
<br/><br/>

## Implementation
- Input: documents (type: list of list(str)) <br/>
  Output: topic distribution of a document
          word distribution of a topic
- Implementation of lda topic model in two different ways.
   1. From scratch ([no-package](no-package))
      - Reference: [here](https://ratsgo.github.io/from%20frequency%20to%20semantics/2017/07/09/lda/)

   2. Using the gensim package ([gensim-package](gensim-package))
      - Reference: [here](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/ldamodel.html) and [here](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/nlp/topic-modeling-gensim-python/)
      - And many more references on the web (google lda gensim)
